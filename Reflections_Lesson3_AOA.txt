Question:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer:
You'd want to use a remote repository when you collaborate with other people or want to keep your files in sync when working from different computers or just to make your work available to other people.

Question:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer:
If, e.g., one of your collaborators pushed changes to the remote repository but you are still working with the old version, you might first want to finish that and only then consolidate with the changes to the remote repository made in the meanwhile.
