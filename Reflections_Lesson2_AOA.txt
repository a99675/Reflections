Question:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer:
Git creates a hidden directory where it will store the change history of the directory and its commits. Creating a repository does however not automatically create an initial commit.
The git repository has to be initialized so that git knows in which directory the files for which you need version control are in.

Question:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Answer:
The staging area contains a subset of the content in the working directory. In contrast to the repository, the staging area does not contain the change history of its contents but only current snapshots.
The staging area helps to separate the changes you make while working into logical pieces. E.g. if you program a website you might change both contents and layout while you're working on it, but you may want to keep track of the changes separately.
