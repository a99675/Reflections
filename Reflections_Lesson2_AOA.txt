Question:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer:
Git creates a hidden directory where it will store the change history of the directory and its commits. Creating a repository does however not automatically create an initial commit.
The git repository has to be initialized so that git knows in which directory the files for which you need version control are in.

Question:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Answer:
The staging area contains a subset of the content in the working directory. In contrast to the repository, the staging area does not contain the change history of its contents but only current snapshots.
The staging area helps to group the changes you make while working into logically related changes. E.g. if you program a website you might change both contents and layout while you're working on it, but you may want to keep track of the changes separately.

Question:
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Answer:
New information on how the staging area works: After committing the staging area has the same state as the last commit. Changes made in the working directory need to be explicitly added to the staging area. This makes it possible to compare both the working directory with the staging area (using git diff) and the staging area with the last commit (using git diff --staged).
Now, in answer to the question, the staging area helps to commit logical changes rather than all the changes that you've just made because it lets you select which changed files you want to commit. Also, you can see exaclty which changes you will commit by comparing the staging area to the working directory on the one hand and, on the other hand, to the last commit.

Question:
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Answer:
Possible situations are when adding new (experimental) features while wanting to keep a working main version where, e.g., only bug fixing takes place, or adding other language versions. Branches are useful for such scenarios because they allow to separate them and group the different change histories.

Question:
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Answer:
The tree diagrams help visualize the branch structure by connecting commits by branches and showing you at one glance where the branches were split off.

Question:
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Answer:
A new commit with the tips of both branches as parents is added which is why we connect it this way in the diagram. The changes are, where possible, merged automatically by git.

Question:
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Answer:
Pros: don't have to analyze each change, saves time, should work for most minor changes
Cons: might not always do what you'd have liked, might miss information by not knowing what changes other people introduces, which, in consequence, might introduce bugs
